    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeon_hub.png" width="1000" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is the Dungeon Hub! You can enter through a portal to this place, and then enter the dungeons!</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeons_mort_menu.png" width="1000" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is the menu you get after clicking on an NPC. <br>The green things in the middle start from left to right, up to down in numerical order <br> this makes it Dungeon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7! each with increasing difficultly of bosses, and getting to the boss! <br> also, if the first 7 are too easy, there is <span style="color:rgb(187, 0, 0)">master mode</span> which drastically increases the health of EVERYTHING (1000x)</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeons_map.png" width="700" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is a map of what the dungeons are inside of them, as you may remember by the color coding: <br> puzzle=purple,mini-bosses=yellow,trap=orange,normal=brown, and 2 other rooms are the green room which is where you start, and the pink, which is a fairy room to revive players that die inside of the dungeon <br>(though dying loses you 2 score, making 300 score unattainable after 4 deaths)<br>also the check marks indicacte how 'done' you are with a room:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>NO CHECK MARK: The main mobs are NOT dead!</li>
            <li>WHITE CHECK MARK: The main mobs are dead, but you don't have all the secrets found in that room!</li>
            <li>GREEN CHECK MARK: The main mobs are dead, and all secrets have been found in that room!</li>
        </ul>
        slightly different for trap room, blood room, and puzzle rooms - you only need to find the secrets/complete the puzzle/kill all the blood room mobs
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeons_blessing.webp" width="500" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is a BLESSING. <br> You get blessings from opening the secret chests scatered across the dungeon, and killing all the main mobs in a room. These give you more damage, speed, defense, and mana, buffing your stats by a substantial amount.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeons_score_sheet.png" width="700" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is the score sheet you get at the end of the dungeon!<br>If you get 100 skill (no deaths), 100 explore (rooms cleared with green check marks) and dont go overtime (speed) you get 300 score (plus 5 as a buffer from killing special mobs)</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeons_final_chest.png" width="700" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is the FINAL chest you get after completing the dungeon clearing phase, secrets, and boss fight, and getting a good enough score of 300 (nearly perfect gameplay), containing (based on what dungeon floor you do) the best loot in the ENTIRE GAME!</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/dungeon_drop.png" width="1000" alt="The Dungeon Hub inside of Skyblock in shaders" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2 class="photo_captions">This is a stick.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="photo_captions">To understand its importance as a rare drop from the final chest (0.1~%)<br>We need to see how much 1 USD is in Skyblock currency - coins - which is about 6.4 million coins (not that much, but not that little)<br><br><br><br><br>This stick costs 1 BILLION coins<br>Or 156 USD (some people have got 100s)<br><br><br><br><br>In a block game.</h2>
