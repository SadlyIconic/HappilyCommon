    <h1>Dear Frie<span style="font-family:Creepster">n</span>ds,
        I h<span style="font-family:Creepster">o</span>pe this letter reaches y<span style="font-family:Creepster">o</span>u i<span style="font-family:Creepster">n</span> b<span style="font-family:Creepster">e</span>tter c<span style="font-family:Creepster">i</span>rcum<span style="font-family:Creepster">s</span>tance<span style="font-family:Creepster">s</span> th<span style="font-family:Creepster">a</span>n when we last spoke. The demon that plagued this place—the one that seemed to have taken over everything—is no more. I’ve <span style="font-family:Creepster">f</span>ac<span style="font-family:Creepster">e</span>d it head-on and with everything I had. It was a battle unlike any I’ve known, but after what felt like an eternity, I have emerged victorious. The demon’s influence is shattered, its grip loosened. This site, once corrupted and twisted, is slowly returning to its natural state. I can almost feel the peace settling in, though I remain cautious. We can’t forget the horrors we’ve witnessed, the darkness it left behind. There are still echoes, but they are fading. I know it’s hard to believe, but we’ve won. You can rest easy now. The nightmare is over, and I’m alive to tell the tale. I just hope that what I’ve done here can serve as a warning—a reminder of what happens when we let our guard down. We may have defeated this demon, but vigilance must remain.
